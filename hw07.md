1）汇编语言（Assembly Language）   

An assembly (or assembler) language,[1] often abbreviated asm, is any low-level 

programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the 

program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.

2）编译（Compiler）

A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a  

high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program. 

A compiler can also be used to convert computer code written in one programming 

language into another programming language. Technically compilers are a type of 

translator that support digital devices, primarily computers. 

3）命令式语言（Imperative programming）

In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses 

statements that change a program's state. 

4）函数编程语言（Functional programming）

In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of 

building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation 

as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable 

data.

5）过程式编程（Procedural programming）

Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured 

programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call.
