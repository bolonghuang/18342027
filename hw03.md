Part one

Write out variables x,y and z in binary code
1)int8_t x =67;int8_t y=-7;int8_t z=y-z;
x = 01000011B;y = 11111001B;z = 10110110B;

2)int8_t x = oxd3;
x = 11010011B;

3)uint8_t x= oxd3;
x = 11010011B;

4)int8_t x = 127;int8_t y = -7;int8_t z = y-x;
x = 01111111B;y = 11111001B;z = 01111010B;

5)float x = 1.125;
x = 00000001.001B;

6)float x = 23.0;
x = 00010111.0B;

7)float x = 0.45;
x = 0.0111001100~B;

overflow :2)int8_t x = oxd3;4)int8_t z = y-x;
Accuracy error ：7)float x = 0.45;

Part two

1)Method of complements 
In mathematics and computing, the method of 
complements is a technique used to subtract one 
number from another using only addition of positive 
numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical
 calculators and is still used in modern computers.

2)Byte 
The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly
consists of eight bits, representing a binary number.
Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode
a single character of text in a computer[1][2] and for this 
reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many 
computer architectures. 
3)Integer (computer science)
to search
In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type,
a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers. 
4)Floating point
In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using
formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so
as to support a trade-off between range and precision.
