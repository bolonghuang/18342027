My first homework  (explain some words)   

1)COMPUTER  

A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of   
arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.

2)COMPUTER SCIENCE    

Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering
 that form the basis for the design and use of computers.![computer science]

3)SOFTWARE  
 
Computer software, or simply software, is a collection of data or computer
 instructions that tell the computer how to work, in contrast to the physical 
 hardware from which the system is built, that actually performs the work. In
 computer science and software engineering, computer software is all information 
 processed by computer systems, programs and data.  ![software]()
   
4) SOFTWARE ENGINEER  
Software engineering is the application of engineering to the development of   
software in a systematic method. ![software engineer]()  
  
5)Alan Turing  
Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an
 English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, 
and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development
of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of 
algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a 
model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father
of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.However, he was also
a tragic figure: a hero who was never fully recognizedin his home country during
his lifetime due to his homosexuality, which was then a crime in the UK.

6)MOoor's law
Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated 
circuit doubles about every two years. ![Moor's low](https://github.com/bolonghuang/18342027/blob/master/Moore's_Law_Transistor_Count_1971-2016.png)
