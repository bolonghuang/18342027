### 计算机硬件基础知识
#1.von Neumann architecture: 

#2.memory&bit

A computer has 64 MB of memory needs 26 bits address

to adress any single byte in memory.

#3.CPU

1)ALU(Arithmetic/Logic Unit)  

2)Control Unit(include two registers:instruction、program counter)
 
 Yes

#4.Secondary memory 
Secondary memory is a non-volatile memory (does not lose stored

data when the device is powered down) that is not directly accessible 

by the CPU, because it is not accessed via the input/output channels

(it is an external device).

example1:flash memory

example2:optical diss

example3:magnetic disks

example4:magnetic tape

#5.5、使用维基百科，解释以下概念

1) CPU

A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer 

that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic 

arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the 

instructions.

2)RAM

Random-access memory (RAM /ræm/) is a form of computer data storage that stores 

data and machine code currently being used. A random-access memory device allows 

data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective 

of the physical location of data inside the memory. 

3)ROM

Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and 

other electronic devices.  Data stored in ROM can only be modified slowly, with 

difficulty, or not at all, so it is mainly used to store firmware (software that 

is closely tied to specific hardware, and unlikely to need frequent updates) or 

application software in plug-in cartridges. 

4）Bus (computing)

In computer architecture, a bus[1] (a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a 

communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or 

between computers. 

5）Parallel Computing 

Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the 

execution of processes are carried out simultaneously.

#6.cloud computing

Cloud computing is shared pools of configurable computer system resources and 

higher-level services that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management 

effort, often over the Internet. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources 

to achieve coherence and economies of scale, similar to a public utility. 


#7.支持双通道DDR3-1333内存， 最大支持16G

1)“3”代表第三代；“1333”代表内存的等效频率。

2）不能

3）能

4）34

备注：

DDR3 SDRAM第三代双倍数据率同步动态随机存取存储器（Double-Data-Rate Three Synchronous Dynamic 

Random Access Memory，一般称为DDR3 SDRAM），是一种计算机存储器规格。它属于SDRAM家族的存储器产品，

提供相较于DDR2 SDRAM更高的运行性能与更低的电压，是DDR2 SDRAM（四倍数据率同步动态随机存取存储器）的

后继者（增加至八倍）。
